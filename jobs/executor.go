// Executor is an implementation of the "Thread-Pool design pattern". Its main purpose is to decouple business logic from the logic necessary for Go-routines management.

// Executor has a fixed amount of workers - Go-routines that execute the actual work (you can specify their amount during Executor construction).
// Executor accepts simple, yet flexible function (func() {}) that you can enqueue for execution.
// Enqueued function will eventually be executed.
// The order enqueued functions are run in is simply the order of executor.EnqueueAsync(func() {}) calls.
// Functions can be executed in parallel - and they will, if you specify workersAmount to be > 1.
//
// Executor can be used in multi-threaded environment (you can enqueue functions from different Go-routines and expect Executor to work correctly).
